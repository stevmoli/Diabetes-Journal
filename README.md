## An app for the Pebble Smartwatch to allow diabetics to easily record their blood sugar readings

This app is a work in progress that was started as a project at a hackathon.  I intend to continue this app and eventually put it on the Pebble App Store.  

As a diabetic, I know firsthand that it can be frustrating to record your blood sugar readings whenever and wherever you test your blood.  I also know how valuable it is to be able to look at your blood sugar data over time and find trends that you can adjust your treatment in order to correct (e.g. "Every day at 5 pm my sugar is high; I better increase my basal insulin rate around that time.").  If an app can allow for quick storing of blood sugar data without a user even needing to take their phone out of their pocket and then allow a user to export that data and visualize/share it in any way they want, hopefully some of the burden of constantly testing, recording, and analyzing blood sugars can be eliminated.

When the app is completed, I intend for it to have the following functionality:
* Upon launch, a blood sugar input screen is displayed, allowing for a user to input their current blood sugar as quickly as possible.  If the app is set by the user to be launched using Pebble's Quick Launch feature, this sugar input screen could be pulled up quickly by simply holding a button.
* If the user inputs a blood sugar reading, the app will either exit upon saving the sugar or pull up a list of blood sugar readings.  This behavior will be configurable in a settings page.
* A user will be able to review past blood sugar readings on their watch.
* A user will be able to pull the data from their watch onto their phone.  The data will be able to be graphed and exported.
